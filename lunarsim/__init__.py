"""LunarSim: a discrete-event testbed for lunar surface cargo logistics.

The package models landers delivering cargo to landing pads near a south-pole
Moon base, a heterogeneous fleet of rovers owned by several operators, Earth
teleoperation under signal delay, the lunar day/night cycle, vehicle failures,
and a set of dispatch mechanisms ranging from "each company moves only its own
cargo" to a pooled marketplace with bundling, team-lift and backhaul.
